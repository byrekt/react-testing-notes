# react-testing-notes
While writing tests for React components at Priceline.com I've encountered many difficult problems in getting 100% test coverage. Even though 100% coverage isn't always necessary, we have a requirement to have 100's across the board. While this guide will include a general overview of testing, it will also include some edge case problems that I've encountered and the solutions that I came up with.
